p2 = Product.create(name:'Surprised Pikachu Enamel Pin - Pokemon Enamel Pin - Funny Enamel Pin - Funny Meme Badge - Gamer Gift', description:'This surprised pikachu enamel pin is the perfect badge for people who love the surprised pikachu meme! Pop it on your coat lapel, bag, or anywhere else and always be prepared for the moment you need to whip out a surprised pika!

Please note: As an eco-friendly store I have opted to exclude the plastic packaging in which enamel pins are normally wrapped. Instead, your pin will come in a colourful paper bag.

* Rubber clutch fastening
* Size: Approx 25 x 20mm
* Comes with backing card approx 55 x 85mm
* Great for bags, coat lapels, etc', price: 8.49, seller_id: u1.id, category_id: 22)
